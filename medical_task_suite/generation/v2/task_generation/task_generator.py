Medical Task Generator — Convert v2.7 ScenarioSpec → tau2-bench multi-turn task JSON.

No agent interaction required. Generates complete, rich task definitions matching
benchmark quality (see benchmark_examples/diabetes_initial_v1.json).

Key quality features:
- Patient-friendly language (not clinical jargon)
- Realistic lab values from lab_reference.json
- Detailed drug info from drug_database.json
- Rich persona with socioeconomic factors, misconceptions
- Populated information tiers with 5-10 items each
- Disease-specific evaluation criteria
- Detailed task instructions for role-playing

Usage:
    from medical_task_suite.generation.v2.task_generation import MedicalTaskGenerator
    from medical_task_suite.clinical_knowledge.accessor import ClinicalKnowledgeBase

    kb = ClinicalKnowledgeBase.get_instance()
    gen = MedicalTaskGenerator(kb)

    # Single task
    task = gen.generate_task(task_type="diagnostic_uncertainty", difficulty="L2")

    # Batch
    tasks = gen.generate_batch(n=50, output_path="tasks/output.json")
