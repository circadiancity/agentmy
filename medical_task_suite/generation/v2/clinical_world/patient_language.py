"""
Patient Language Layer — Convert clinical terminology to patient-friendly speech.

Problem: disease_profiles give us clinical questions ("Have you noticed increased thirst?")
         and medical terms ("bronchial asthma", "SARS-CoV-2", "hemoglobin SS disease").
         Real patients say "I've been really thirsty lately" or "I can't breathe well".

This module provides:
1. clinical_to_patient(): Convert any clinical term to patient-friendly language
2. generate_patient_complaint(): Generate natural chief complaint for a disease
3. symptom_to_patient_response(): Convert symptom to natural patient speech
